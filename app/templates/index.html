        <h3 class="blue-title">Working With The Sheet:</h3>
        <p>
            The ESL Auto Worksheet comes with fill-in-the-blank comprehension questions, as well as some general debate-style questions
            for students to get talking.
            <br/>
            Confident teachers, or teachers looking for a quick filler activity, may use the sheet as-is, but we recommend the user to check over the article before 
            using it in a class.<br/>
            Consider cutting paragraphs out of the article to make it shorter, removing excess definitions for words, and adding your own more specific comprehension and discussion questions.

        </p>
        <p>
            Consider asking students to take turn reading. Alternatively, tell students they can read between three and five lines.<br/>
            Students can circle new vocabulary and sentence structures, too. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For a more reading-based sheet, consider adding multiple choice questions based on vocabulary and comprehension.
            For a more discussion-based sheet, ask students their for anecdotes and opinions on specific parts of the article.<br/>
            Students could make arguments to convince someone in the article to change their mind.
        </p>
   

    <!-- <p>The Auto-Worksheet program lets you enter a search term, and will gather news articles from the CNN website for you to use in your ESL class.</p>
    <p>Select an article you like and it automatically chooses several notable words and collects the definitions from Dictionary.com</p>
    <p>You will then be able to download a .docx file containing the article and vocabulary, and three automatically generated fill-in-the-blank questions.
        <br>The file will also contain three general discussion questions.</p>
    <p>Auto-Worksheet makes finding articles and producing questions easier for you.
        Once downloaded, You can either add your own questions, or use the worksheet as-is.
