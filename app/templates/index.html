    <p>Select an article you like and it automatically chooses several notable words and collects the definitions from Dictionary.com</p>
    <p>You will then be able to download a .docx file containing the article and vocabulary, and three automatically generated fill-in-the-blank questions.
        <br>The file will also contain three general discussion questions.</p>
    <p>Auto-Worksheet makes finding articles and producing questions easier for you.
